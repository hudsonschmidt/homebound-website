                    <h4>What is Homebound?</h4>
                    <p>Homebound is a personal safety app for outdoor adventurers. Create trip plans with your expected return time, add safety contacts, and if you don't check out on time, your contacts are automatically notified with your trip details and location. It's a simple safety net that gives you freedom to explore while giving loved ones peace of mind.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What can I use Homebound for?</h4>
                    <p>Anything you want! The idea for this app originally was to encourage more people to explore our beautiful Earth, staying safe while doing so. But throughout development, this app has turned into something bigger. Homebound can be used in any situation where you want someone to know where you're going and when you expect to be back/there. For example, college students walking back to their dorms at night, parents tracking kids on field trips, going out to bars with friends, or college students going out to frats/parties. Even just letting a roommate know when you'll be back from grocery shopping. The idea of Homebound is to help you come up with a plan and share it with someone you trust, so that if something goes wrong, they have the information they need to help you.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How do I create a trip?</h4>
                    <p>Tap the "+" button on the home screen to create a new trip. You'll set your activity type (hiking, climbing, skiing, etc.), add your location, set your start time and expected return time (ETA), choose a grace period, and select your safety contacts (up to 2 on the free plan, or 5 with Homebound+). You can also add notes with important details like your planned route or gear you're carrying.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What happens if I don't check out on time?</h4>
                    <p>If you don't check out by your ETA plus your grace period, Homebound automatically sends notifications to your safety contacts. They'll receive your trip details including activity type, location, notes, and your last known position. This ensures someone knows to check on you if something goes wrong.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What is a grace period?</h4>
                    <p>The grace period is extra time added after your ETA before alerts are sent. For example, if your ETA is 5:00 PM with a 30-minute grace period, contacts won't be notified until 5:30 PM. This prevents false alarms for minor delays like traffic or taking a longer break. You can customize the grace period for each trip.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Is Homebound a replacement for calling 911?</h4>
                    <p><strong>No.</strong> Homebound is a supplementary safety tool that notifies your personal contacts. It does not contact emergency services or dispatch help. In an emergency, always call 911 (or your local emergency number) first. Homebound is meant to work alongside proper safety planning, not replace it.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What are custom notification messages?</h4>
                    <p>Custom messages let you personalize the notifications your contacts receive. Instead of generic text, you can write your own trip start message and overdue alert message. This is useful for adding personal touches or specific instructions for your contacts. Custom messages are available to all users.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How do I save a trip for reuse?</h4>
                    <p>After creating a trip, you can save it as a template. Saved trips remember your activity, location, contacts, and settings so you can quickly recreate them. You can save up to 10 trip templates.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How do I add safety contacts?</h4>
                    <p>Go to the Contacts tab to add people you trust. Enter their name and email address (phone number is optional). Once added, you can select them as safety contacts when creating trips. Free users can add up to 2 contacts per trip, while Homebound+ subscribers can add up to 5.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Do my contacts need to download the app?</h4>
                    <p>No. Your safety contacts receive notifications via email. They don't need to download Homebound or create an account. However, if they do have Homebound, you can add them as friends for additional features like seeing each other's active trips.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What notifications do my contacts receive?</h4>
                    <p>Your safety contacts receive emails when:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You start a trip (with trip details and your location)</li>
                        <li>You check in during a trip (with your current location if enabled)</li>
                        <li>You complete a trip safely</li>
                        <li>You go overdue (haven't checked out by ETA + grace period)</li>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Can I use friends as safety contacts?</h4>
                    <p>Yes! If you've connected with other Homebound users as friends, you can add them as safety contacts for your trips. They'll receive the same notifications as regular contacts, plus they can view your trip details and live location (if enabled) directly in their app.</p>

                    <p>Go to the Friends tab and tap "Add Friend" to generate an invite link. Share this link with someone you know. When they tap it, they'll be prompted to accept your friend request. You can also accept incoming friend requests from others.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Can friends request updates from me?</h4>
                    <p>If you enable "Allow Update Requests" in your privacy settings, friends can send you a request to check in during an active trip. You'll receive a notification and can choose to check in. This is useful if someone is worried and wants confirmation you're okay.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How do I remove a friend?</h4>
                    <p>Go to the Friends tab, find the friend you want to remove, and tap on their profile. You'll see an option to remove them. Once removed, they won't be able to see your trips or add you as a safety contact.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What is live location sharing?</h4>
                    <p>Live location sharing lets your safety contacts see your real-time position during an active trip. When enabled, your location is updated continuously so contacts can follow your progress on a map. This is completely optional and must be enabled for each trip.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How do I enable live location?</h4>
                    <p>When creating a trip, toggle "Share Live Location" to enable it for that specific trip. You can also set a default preference in Settings > Privacy > "Allow Live Location Sharing." Live location only activates when you check in to start your trip.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Does live location drain my battery?</h4>
                    <p>Live location sharing does use more battery than normal since it requires continuous GPS access. We recommend starting your trip with a full battery or bringing a portable charger for longer adventures. You can disable live location at any time to conserve battery.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How accurate is live location?</h4>
                    <p>Accuracy depends on your device's GPS capabilities and environmental conditions. In open areas with clear sky view, accuracy is typically within a few meters. In canyons, dense forests, or indoors, accuracy may be reduced. Live location should be treated as an approximate guide, not a precise tracking system.</p>

                <h3>Safety Insights & Score</h3>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What is the safety score?</h4>
                    <p>Your safety score is a 0-100 rating computed from your trip history. It's based on three factors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>On-time rate (40%):</strong> Did you check out before your ETA plus grace period expired?</li>
                        <li><strong>Check-in rate (30%):</strong> Did you check in during trips where you enabled check-in reminders?</li>
                        <li><strong>Contact coverage (30%):</strong> How many safety contacts did you assign to your trips?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Scores are graded as: A+ (90-100), A (80-89), B (70-79), C (60-69), D (50-59), F (below 50).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How does check-in rate work?</h4>
                    <p>Check-in rate only applies to trips where you enabled check-in reminders (set a check-in interval). If you don't use check-in reminders, this factor doesn't affect your score negatively.</p>
                    <p>When you do enable check-in reminders:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Checking in at least once during your trip gives you full credit for that trip</li>
                        <li>Skipping all check-ins on a trip where you enabled reminders counts as 0% for that trip</li>
                        <li>Your overall check-in rate is the average across all trips with reminders enabled</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Trip length tiers:</strong> To keep scoring fair, trip length is capped based on duration:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Under 1 hour: capped at 60 minutes</li>
                        <li>1-4 hours: capped at 120 minutes</li>
                        <li>4-8 hours: capped at 240 minutes</li>
                        <li>8+ hours: capped at 480 minutes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> rate = (check-ins ÷ capped length) × 1200, maxing out at 100%.</p>
                    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>6-hour hike (240 min cap), 3 check-ins: (3 ÷ 240) × 1200 = 15 → caps at 100%</li>
                        <li>2-hour trip (120 min cap), 1 check-in: (1 ÷ 120) × 1200 = 10 → caps at 100%</li>
                        <li>2-hour trip (120 min cap), 0 check-ins: (0 ÷ 120) × 1200 = 0%</li>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What is the weekly recap?</h4>
                    <p>The weekly recap summarizes your adventure activity for the current week. It shows your trip count, total adventure hours, whether all trips were completed safely, any overdue incidents, and your busiest day of the week.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Is my safety data sent to your servers?</h4>
                    <p>No. Your safety score and weekly recap are computed entirely on your device using trip data already stored locally. No additional data is collected, transmitted, or stored on our servers for these features.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How can I improve my safety score?</h4>
                    <p>Check out on time before your ETA plus grace period expires, check in regularly during trips that have check-in intervals set, and complete your trips rather than cancelling them. Consistent safe habits will raise your score over time.</p>
