            <p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h3>3.1 Supplementary Tool Only</h3>
        <p>Homebound is designed as a <strong>supplementary safety tool</strong> to enhance your personal safety planning. It is <strong>NOT</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A replacement for proper safety planning and preparation</li>
            <li>An emergency response service</li>
            <li>A substitute for calling 911 or emergency services</li>
            <li>A guarantee of rescue or emergency assistance</li>
            <li>A replacement for informing others of your plans in person</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 No Guarantee of Performance</h3>
        <p>We do not guarantee that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Notifications will be delivered on time or at all</li>
            <li>The App will function without interruption or errors</li>
            <li>Your emergency contacts will receive or respond to alerts</li>
            <li>Emergency services or search and rescue will be notified or respond</li>
            <li>The App will be available in all locations or conditions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.3 Your Responsibility</h3>
        <p><strong>You are solely responsible for your own safety.</strong> This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Making sound decisions about your activities and their risks</li>
            <li>Carrying appropriate safety equipment</li>
            <li>Informing others of your plans through multiple means</li>
            <li>Having backup communication methods</li>
            <li>Not relying exclusively on Homebound for your safety</li>
            <li>Checking weather, trail conditions, and other relevant information</li>
            <li>Having proper training and experience for your activities</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.4 Technical Limitations</h3>
        <p>The App may experience:</p>
        <ul>

        <h3>3.5 Live Location Sharing Limitations</h3>
        <p>If you enable live location sharing, you acknowledge that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Location accuracy depends on your device's GPS capabilities and environmental conditions</li>
            <li>Location updates may be delayed or interrupted due to network conditions</li>
            <li>Sharing live location increases battery consumption on your device</li>
            <li>Location data may not reflect your actual position in areas with poor GPS coverage (canyons, dense forests, indoors, etc.)</li>
            <li>Live location is a supplementary feature and does not guarantee your safety contacts can locate you</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.6 Group Trip Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>For group trips with multiple participants:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each participant is responsible for their own safety</li>
            <li>The trip owner does not assume responsibility for other participants' safety</li>
            <li>Check-out rules (voting, owner-only, etc.) are coordination tools, not safety guarantees</li>
            <li>All participants should independently inform their own emergency contacts</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.7 Emergency Contacts</h3>
        <p>Adding emergency contacts to Homebound:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Does not guarantee they will receive notifications</li>
            <li>Does not guarantee they will take action</li>
            <li>Does not create any obligation on their part</li>
            <li>Is not a substitute for personally informing them of your plans</li>
        </ul>
